        Sensors indicate no shuttle or other ships in this sector. According to coordinates, we have travelled 7,000 light years and are located near the <a href="#">system J-25</a>. Tractor beam released, sir. Force field maintaining our hull integrity. Damage report? <a href="#" id="sections">Sections 27, 28 and 29</a> on decks four, five and six destroyed. Without our shields, at this range it is probable a photon detonation could destroy the Enterprise.

What is the strength of the ship's deflector shields at maximum output? The wormhole's size and short period would make this a local phenomenon. Do you have sufficient data to compile a holographic simulation?

        We're acquainted with the wormhole phenomenon, but this... Is a remarkable piece of bio-electronic engineering by which I see much of the <a href="#">EM spectrum</a> ranging from heat and infrared through radio waves, et cetera, and forgive me if I've said and listened to this a thousand times. This planet's interior heat provides an abundance of geothermal energy. We need to neutralize the homing signal.
